<div class="informative">
	<h3>Overview</h3>
	<p>Northwestern students feel disconnected from the majority of student group programming. Students do not feel they are aware of all the events they want to attend, and student groups are unsure how to reach their audiences. We addressed these needs by providing a new advertising system that connects students to the events that excite them.</p>
</div>


<div class="informative">
	<h3>User Research</h3>
	<p>In our initial interviews students said they never looked through the advertising on campus. The flyer boards are daunting and students do not feel it is worth taking the time to sift through what is posted. Our group used the feedback we receiverd to brainstorm some How Might We questions to help inspire our team and refine our problem space.</p>

<div class="informative">
	<h3>Initial Concepts</h3>
	<p>Our team believed there was an opportunity to take advantage of digital boards across Northwesternâ€™s campus. These boards currently advertise events put on by the university, but nothing done by student groups or other organizations in the Northwestern community. Students told us they were not interested in the current advertising. We believed these display boards would make an eco-friendly alternative to physical flyering that would clean up after itself.
	We wanted to pair these digital ads with a social app students could use at their own convenience to see all upcoming events for student groups on campus. We wireframed both a news feed-style app and a Tinder-esque app where students could add events to their calendars and subscribe to specific student groups so their feeds could be personalized.

	<h3>User Feedback</h3>
	<p>The response we got to the digital boards was lukewarm, but allowed us to uncover the real pain point students really had with the flyering on campus. When students are on their way to and from class, they are often already late. Nobody is willing to take the time to stop and look at advertisements when they are in academic buildings.
	Students had a positive reaction to a phone app, and preferred a news feed where they could scroll through every upcoming event rather than only seeing one at a time. Having a personalized feed was a popular feature, but they also wanted to be able to see events that were popular throughout Northwestern and popular with their friends.
	</p>
</div>

<div class="informative">
	<h3>Final Concept</h3>
	<p>We decided to take advantage of the two things every student carries on them: their cell phones and student ID cards (Wildcards). The news feed phone app was fleshed out into three tabs: a personalized feed of upcoming events for subscriptions, a feed of popular events coming up on campus, and a list of the events that have been saved.</p>

	<p>The physical component of our product was a Wildcard scanner for student groups. If a student sees a group they are interested in at a organization fair, for example, they can tap their Wildcard to subscribe to the group in the What's NU app, which is connected to students Northwestern accounts. Students can also use the app to find exciting events, and can purchase tickets to these events through the app. The app is connected to students' Northwestern accounts, so they can use their Wildcards as the physical form of their event tickets.</p>

	<h3>Conclusion</h3>
	<p>This was a fun opportunity to dive into an issue that has plagued Northwestern throughout my time on campus, and I would love an opportunity to further refine and develop this product to help other students in the future.</p>
