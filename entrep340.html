	<h3>Overview</h3>
	<p>Our team wanted to find a way to support the homeless population in Chicago. We began by looking at how people might give money to people on the streets, but ended up discovering a whole new set of problems that excited us. We settled on developing a modular piece of furniture that would easily fit into the homes of people being relocated to temporary or permanent housing.</p>
</div>


<div class="informative">
	<h3>Background Research</h3>
	<p>We reached out to many organizations in Chicago focused on helping the homeless, and our perceptions were completely changed. We discovered there is a "continuum of care" being provided by these organizations. This means they not only help these people find food and shelter, but address underlying mental health and substance abuse issues, find jobs, and support them in whatever other ways they can. These discussions prompted us to pivot, and find some way we could fit into this continuum and provide a resource that was not yet available.</p>

	<h3>Initial Direction</h3>
	<p>With this new focus in mind, we spoke with the Chicago Furniture Bank about the issues they face. Their organization takes in furniture donations and bundles it for people moving into low-income housing in Chicago. James McPhail, the CEO, told me they are always in need of beds, as well as small sofas and small dining tables.

	<h3>Competitive Research</h3>
	<p>We began looking into modular furniture for inspiration. The people who are moving from homelessness into permanent housing are given very small apartments that do not fit much furniture. We wanted to help provide spaces where these families could eat and spend family time together. Looking at the market for modular furniture, we thought we could offer a cheaper option to consumers, and use the proceeds to donate pieces to the furniture bank, where people moving out of homelessness already go for furniture.
	</p>

	<h3>Design Concept</h3>
	<p>Of course, we had to design this modular furniture piece. I wanted to meet multiple needs of the furniture bank with our prototype, and I settled on a sofa/dining table combination because these pieces could both exist in a living room in a small apartment. I also observed that many dining tables were roughly the height of couch backs, and so I thought there could be an easy way for a piece to transition between the two.</p>

	<p>Our product is a sofa section in the upright position. When the cube is moved away from the sofa back, the couch cushion can be removed and the back can be folded out into a table, where the cube offers seating as a stool. The cube would also have a removable top, allowing for storage inside. There is also wood on the other side of the cube's top, so they can be used as coffee tables or ottomans if purchased separately.</p>

	<p>We envisioned selling these as sectionals so they could be configured to fit unusual or small dimensions of an apartment. </p>

	<h3>Conclusion</h3>
	<p>I really enjoyed this opportunity to work on a product with a social impact. If I had more time, I would have liked to figure out a storage solution for the sofa back cushion. But this was a fun chance to expand on my Photoshop and sketching skills, trying to visually tell a story.</p>
