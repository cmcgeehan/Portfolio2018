	<h3>Overview</h3>
	<p>Our team wanted to find a way to support the homeless population in Chicago. We began by looking at how people might give money to people on the streets, but ended up discovering a whole new set of problems that excited us. We settled on developing a modular piece of furniture that would easily fit into the homes of people being relocated to temporary or permanent housing.</p>
</div>


<div class="informative">
	<h3>Background Research</h3>
	<p>We reached out to many organizations in Chicago focused on helping the homeless, and our perceptions were completely changed. We discovered there is a "continuum of care" being provided by these organizations. This means they not only help these people find food and shelter, but address underlying mental health and substance abuse issues, find jobs, and support them in whatever other ways they can. These discussions prompted us to pivot, and find some way we could fit into this continuum and provide a resource that was not yet available.</p>

	<h3>Initial Direction</h3>
	<p>With this new focus in mind, we spoke with the Chicago Furniture Bank about the issues they face. Their organization takes in furniture donations and bundles it for people moving into low-income housing in Chicago. James McPhail, the CEO, told me they are always in need of beds, as well as small sofas and small dining tables.

	<h3>Competitive Research</h3>
	<p>We began looking into modular furniture for inspiration. The people who are moving from homelessness into permanent housing are given very small apartments that do not fit much furniture. 
	</p>
</div>

<div class="informative">
	<h3>Final Concept</h3>
	<p>We decided to take advantage of the two things every student carries on them: their cell phones and student ID cards (Wildcards). The news feed phone app was fleshed out into three tabs: a personalized feed of upcoming events for subscriptions, a feed of popular events coming up on campus, and a list of the events that have been saved.</p>

</div>
<div class="informative" style="margin-top:0;">
	<p>The physical component of our product was a Wildcard scanner for student groups. If a student sees a group they are interested in at a organization fair, for example, they can tap their Wildcard to subscribe to the group in the What's NU app, which is connected to students Northwestern accounts. Students can also use the app to find exciting events, and can purchase tickets to these events through the app. The app is connected to students' Northwestern accounts, so they can use their Wildcards as the physical form of their event tickets.</p>

	<h3>Conclusion</h3>
	<p>This was a fun opportunity to dive into an issue that has plagued Northwestern throughout my time on campus, and I would love an opportunity to further refine and develop this product to help other students in the future.</p>
