<div class="informative">
	<h3>Overview</h3>
	<p>Our team of four associates was given the opportunity to uncover a problem within the legal industry and create a solution over 13 weeks. We chose to develop a solution geared towards those who manage financials at lawfirms. This includes partners, who manage relations with particular clients, as well as matter management attorneys, who oversee both the legal work and financials for particular matters.</p>

	<h3>Pain Points</h3>
	<p>We chose to work with matter management attorneys because we were able to identify the following pain points in their everyday work:</p>
	<ul class="vertical">
		<li><p>It is difficult to tell whether matters are running over budget - let alone the amount by which they are running over - until bills are being sent out. This often leads to firms not being paid for all of the work that is being done on matters.</p></li>
		<li><p>Law firms do not have an accurate idea as to how much money they will bring in for the matters on which they are working.</p></li>
		<li><p>Client often want to know how much money they currently owe to their attorneys. This information is spread across multiple systems and only stored at the matter level, so compiling an accurate number is a tedious, manual process.</p></li>
	</ul>
